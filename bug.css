The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you try to use `calc()` with units that aren't compatible, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For instance, attempting to add pixels and percentages directly can cause problems.  This is because percentages are relative to the parent container's dimensions, while pixels are absolute units.  The browser may not be able to resolve this ambiguity, resulting in the calculation failing or rendering incorrectly.
